This is a simple network client/server written in C. The server waits for the client to send requests.

The requests are as follows:
OPEN, READ, WRITE, STAT, CLOSE

The client passes in a filename to OPEN and the server returns the file descriptor associated with it.

READ then uses this file descriptor to view the file.

WRITE writes to the file using the file descriptor from open

STAT calls the fstat() function and populates a custom struct with file statistics such as modification time, creation time, file size.

CLOSE closes the file using the same file descriptor.

In order to compile, just run make. This will produce a SNFSclient and SNFSserver binary. The server is run with ./serverSNFS -port <port> -mount <mountpoint>. The client is run with ./clientSNFS <server> <port> <filename>.

To speed things up, there is a rule that will compile and run all of the necessary binaries with a random port and file path. If you would like to run this, simply run make testserver
